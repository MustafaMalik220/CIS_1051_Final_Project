### Challenges and Future Implementations
- The major challenges I had were researching and testing the math for compounding interest and optimal repayment strategies.
- In the future I want to add a feature where the user can input future student loans they’ll need if they’re still in school. Also, I want to make it so that the program can read loan reports from other student loan companies.
