# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Student Loan Planner

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that organizes your student loans and makes a payment plan.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The first step for the program will be to read files from federal and private student loan companies. Then extract information about the loans such as the loan amount, disbursement date, and interest rate. Additional information will be manually entered such as graduation date, additional loans, and payment amount. The program will output a graph of the total amount vs time and a log of the payments. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?



## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.



## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Make a sample loan statement for FAFSA and Sallie Mae for the program to extract loan information from. Allow user to manually input additional loans. Output a graph of the total amount vs time and a log of the payments.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Show how much money can be saved by letting the program make a payment plan (instead of paying off one student loan then moving on to the next). Display graphs for each loan. Create a view for every loan that includes a pie chart showing the principal and interest. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Account for variable interest rates. Be able to read files from other private student loan companies. Allow user to input multiple payment amounts for different time periods. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The first step is to come up with a strategy the program will use to save the most money when making loan payments. The payment will be distributed between the loans proportional to the amount of interest each loan is incurring. Next, I will obtain sample loan statements from FAFSA and Sallie Mae to use as examples. I will need to learn a python graphing library such as Matplotlib for making graphs.
